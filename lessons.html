                <p>
                    I have been teaching private students since 1996 and working with drumlines and percussion sections since 1999.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that time, I have taught hundreds of students privately through my own home studio as well as some of the premier 
                    private music schools in Chattanooga and Birmingham, including: The Cadek Conservatory of Music at UTC, Music Instruction 
                    Studio (Chattanooga, TN), the Birmingham School of Music, and Mason Music (Birmingham, AL). I have helped countless students 
                    reach their personal musical goals of playing in bands, attaining spots in honor bands, and excelling in their school music 
                    departments and band programs. I have even had several students go on to pursue a career as a professional musician or music 
                    educator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also worked as a percussion and drumline instructor at over a dozen schools throughout Chattanooga, North Georgia, 
                    Atlanta and Birmingham.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tailor my lesson plans to each individual student and their goals. Whether that goal is to play in a band with their friends or 
                    to enter into a collegiate music program or join a working band, I can help!
