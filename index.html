                    My name is Adam Blevins and I am a professional drummer and percussionist residing in the greater Chattanooga, TN area.
                    I teach drum and percussion lessons at several area public schools as well as in my home studio located just outside 
                    Chattanooga. In a addition to my teaching duties, I also play gigs all over the southeast as my schedule allows.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Since 1996 I have taught hundreds of students in virtually all areas of percussion and styles of music, ranging from 
                    orchestral percussion and jazz drum set to contemporary drum set styles including: pop/rock, country, Latin/Afro-Cuban, 
                    heavy metal, fusion, and more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you would like to book me for a live or studio gig, or if you would like to inquire about private lessons or having 
                    me work with your school drumline or percussion section, you can contact me via e-mail at blevinspercussion@gmail.com.
