                    My name is Adam Blevins and I am a professional drummer and percussionist residing in the greater Chattanooga, TN area.
                    I teach drum and percussion lessons at several area public schools as well as in my home studio located just outside 
                    Chattanooga. In a addition to my teaching duties, I also play gigs all over the southeast as my schedule allows.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since 1996 I have taught hundreds of students in virtually all areas of percussion and styles of music, ranging from 
                    orchestral percussion and jazz drum set to contemporary drum set styles including: pop/rock, country, Latin/Afro-Cuban, 
                    heavy metal, fusion, and more!

                    your school's percussion section or drumline!
