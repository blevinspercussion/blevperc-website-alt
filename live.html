                I have been performing professionally on drums and percussion for over 20 years in a wide
                variety of styles and situations.

                While a student at UTC I performed in student ensembles including marching band, jazz band, 
                percussion ensemble, wind ensemble, symphonic band, and university orchestra. While a music 
                performance major I also performed professionally with the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera.

                In 2010 I moved to Birmingham, Alabama to further my music career. While in Birmingham, I 
                worked my way up the music scene playing with some of the most in-demand musical acts in 
                the area. I quickly made a name for myself as a substitute player due to my ability to 
                accurately learn a large amount of material in a short amount of time.
            </p>
